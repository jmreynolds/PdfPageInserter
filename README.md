# PdfPageInserter
Need to insert a blank page into some PDFs? Here you go!

Goal is to have a small app that lets you:

1. Define the location of a PDF
2. Define the number of pages in a sequence (letter, statement, etc)
3. Define the interval for inserting a blank page
4. Define the output PDF

NOTE:
As of January 31, 2016 - no further development will be done on the version of this 
software under the GPL License. We will be migrating to the MIT license with our next 
feature branch, and integrating a different underlying PDF utility.

Thanks!
